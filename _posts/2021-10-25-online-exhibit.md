title: Natural History Museum online exhibit - Wildlife Photographer of the Year gallery
---

## Background
The Wildlife Photographer of the Year competition has been run by the Natural History Museum every year since 1964. This competition aims to promote honest and ethical photography and try to convey the beauty and fragility of the natural world. By 2008, it received 32,000 entries per year. We looked at the online gallery, which contains prizewinning entries since 2010. Moreover, the competition is divided into adult and young photographer contests.


## Layout
At the top of the website is the navigation module about the exhibition. In addition to Exploring the gallery, there are other modules related to the photography contest. And at the beginning of the Exploring the gallery page, the website briefly introduced the exhibition. There is a filter button on the left for image screening, and at the bottom is an online form where people can sign up for the Wildlife Photographer of the Year newsletter. The other main part of the page is the photo display of the photo contest, with two to three photos per line. Each photo does not have a title, but each photo will be marked with the name of the creator in the upper right corner. And if you click on the photo, you will get the detailed metadata introduction of the image, which contains the enlarged and clear version of the image itself, as well as the introduction of the image and the information of the creator, the keywords of the image, and the page will include other images of the same creator in the gallery. 


## User experience
For users browsing the main page of the website, they can easily find filters to change the image range. And when you scroll through the photos, the filter tab will move up and down with the slide, so users won’t find the filter. In addition, there are simple comments and keyword hashtag extraction on the picture information page. This function can help users do the research of photos in more detail and accurately. And the website will accurately mark the winner of each contest at the top of the picture. This is also a respect for the contestants. Moreover, Videos and articles related to pictures are also informative and interesting.



## Filter functionality
This function is very effective in improving the search and screening of pictures. The filter is divided into six parts: dates, competitions, awards, categories, locations, and species. And each photo has a hashtag. In addition to the fixed 6 modules, and there are keyword extraction options such as highly recommend, South America, or a popular trend of the year, people can edit the filter. This is a very good experience.


## Categories
Regarding the categories and navigation of the website, I think it is very complete. The website has detailed two main content modules: Gallery and the Competition of Wildlife Photographer. Moreover, the website created online shops and book tickets. This has increased people’s experience on the Internet when the Covid-19 has not fully recovered.  And at the bottom of the website is the contact information of social media, which provides more diversified choices for people to learn more about events and information. It also gave a better way for publicity.
