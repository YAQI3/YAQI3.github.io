title: Blog of “A time capsule” in Natural History Museum virtual museum
---

My blog revolves around whales. In scientific exploration, time always leaves many interesting historical traces for scientific collection.

Through online interaction, there is a lot about blue whale science,  whales living in the ocean, and people's records and collections of whales."A time capsule" is an interesting discovery for my exploration of the museum. This is a capsule with a history of more than 120 years wrapped in the skeleton of a whale. It is understood that the whale skeleton was first displayed in 1930, but at that time, the cartilage discs were lost. So the experts needed to make new discs for the skeleton, and they used newspapers from the morning commute to make these cartilage discs. Those newspapers are like a time capsule in the collection process of the skeleton, opening up how people restore the skeleton 120 years ago.
